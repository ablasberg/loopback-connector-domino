# loopback-connector-domino

LoopBack connector for Domino.  This connector uses the Domino Access Services (DAS) data API
to create, read, update and delete documents in a Domino application.

## Getting Started

The easiest way to get started is to add **loopback-connector-domino** to the
[LoopBack tutorial application](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-getting-started).
Connect the Domino data source to the CoffeeShops model, get familiar with the connector,
and then use it in your own LoopBack API.

### Prerequisites

- A Domino server runnint the HTTP task.  This server must have the Domino data API enabled.
- Node.js and npm.
- A clone of [loopback-getting-started](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-getting-started).
If you haven't already done so, clone **loopback-getting-started** first.

### Installation

Clone this repository on the same system where you installed **loopback-getting-started**...
